# Taken Commands List, by the modules in module-universe

This contains a short list of all the commands taken, besides the stock ones, to aid module developers in choosing a proper name for their command. Consider these names as taken, and you cannot use them anymore. Be creative :)

## Taken commands:

 - ``.python`` - python interpreter module (python.py)
 - ``.req`` - requirements installer module (req_installer.py)
 - ``.nhentai`` - nhentai module (nhentai.py)
 - ``.sudo`` - superuser module (superuser.py)
