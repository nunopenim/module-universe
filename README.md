## What is this?

HyperUBot's module universe is an official 
[community repo](https://github.com/prototype74/HyperUBot/wiki/Community-Repos) 
made by the owners of 
[HyperUBot](https://github.com/prototype74/HyperUBot). This repo includes 
extra modules (user modules) that are installable via the Package Manager in 
the userbot.

## Developing modules

A small, introductory guide in how to develop your own modules can be found 
[here](https://github.com/prototype74/HyperUBot/wiki/Developing-Modules). 
This explains the basics in how to setup your module's `.py` file, so that 
HyperUBot can load it and run it when it is called.

## Hosting your own community repo

To host your own HyperUBot modules repository, for multiple (or not) modules, 
you will need to drop the `.py` files in a `Release` of your Repo. A full guide 
in doing this can be found 
[here](https://github.com/prototype74/HyperUBot/wiki/Community-Repos#how-to-host-your-own-community-repo). 
In here, we also have some recommendations to follow, such as opening a News 
Channel about your repo, or how to proceed with external dependencies, in case 
you need them.

## Can I have my module(s) hosted in the official repo?

Sure why not:

1. Fork the repository
2. Commit your modules to `src` folder
3. Create a pull request here
4. Tell us the name and purpose of the module(s)

That's it! If a pull request is made, we will review it. If your module(s) meet 
the requirements, it/they will be added here.

### But what are the requirements?

- **Follow the rules**. The rules are the same as in the 
[community repo](https://github.com/prototype74/HyperUBot/wiki/Community-Repos#rules-i-dont-think-so) 
wiki except that we **will check** if you actually did follow the rules
- Your code should be in [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
- Don't "port" modules (plugins) from other userbots. The only exception is 
that you're the code owner of the ported module(s) (plugins)
