## What is this?

This is just a repo to keep the sources of the extra modules, that doubles down as the modules-universe for the HyperUBot project. If you are looking for the actual HyperUBot project, [check this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNHsw8TLf6Y) instead!  

## Can I have my files hosted in the official repo?

Right now, since we are still trying to solve some stuff as the Userbot just launched to public, community files are not yet accepted. However in the future, there will be a dedicated telegram group, which a link will be added here. In there you can submit your module, so that we can evaluate the content. If everything is right, and there are no problems at all or suspicious stuff, it will make here!

## Hosting your own community repo

To host your own HyperUBot modules repository, for multiple (or not) modules, you will need to drop the .py files in a Release of your Repo. A full guide in doing this can be found [here](https://github.com/nunopenim/module-universe/blob/master/GUIDE_HostingYourOwnRepo.md). In here, we also have some recommendations to follow, such as opening a News Channel about your repo, or how to proceed with external dependencies, in case you need them.
