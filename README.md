# Hosting your own community repo
The package manager system of the bot runs using my [pyGitHub_API](https://github.com/nunopenim/pyGitHub_API) library. This library can only see the Releases of a GitHub repo, so to host your own, you need to create a release. A full tutorial will come out soon enough. It is recommended that to add a file to the repo, you edit the release, instead of creating a new one.
